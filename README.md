### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2020

+ Projec title: Heavy Metal: the Rebel Child of Rock
+ This project is conducted by Kexin (Colleen) Su

+ Project summary: In this project, I analyzed and compared the lyrics of rock and metal music. The results show that rock music encompass a wide range of themes, including both positive and negative. The sentiment of its lyrics are relatively neutral and stable over the years. The emotions that the songs carry are mixed, with "joy" and "sadness" being the prevailing emotion. Metal music's theme are more dark and occult than rock music, with significantly more negative word choice. The lyrics carry negative sentiments and are unstable until around 2004. The emotions of the songs are mostly pessimistic, with "fear" and "sadness" being the leading emotion.
