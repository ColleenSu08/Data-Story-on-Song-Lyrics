# ADS Project 1:  R Notebook on Lyrics Analysis

### Code lib Folder

ADS Proj1 is the markdown that generates the output html file. 

The packages I used are sentimentr, ggplot2 and dplyr. 

Sentimentr is used to carry out sentiment analysis of the lyrics, including acquiring sentiment score and emotions.

ggplot2 is used to create relative graphs including histogram and boxplot.

dplyr is used to make desirable changes to the dataframe.
